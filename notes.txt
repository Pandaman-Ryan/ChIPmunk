Test on small region (make --region flag)

Will probably have to have better way to keep track of fragments. Maybe:
- write to disk each time
- keep in linked list (e.g. vector with each pos in genome linking to fragments starting there)

In future can wrap shearing + pulldown into one step (e.g. don't keep fragments tha don't get pulled down)

Building docker:
docker build -t gymreklab/chipmunk-1.7 .
docker push gymreklab/chipmunk-1.7
